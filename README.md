The Chrome Adblocker Extension is a browser extension designed to block unwanted advertisements on websites by intercepting HTTP requests. The extension utilizes Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API to match web requests against a list of known ad provider URLs. Once installed, the extension runs in the background, ensuring that any requests to ads are blocked, resulting in an ad-free browsing experience. The core functionality relies on JSON-based rules to filter and prevent ad traffic from being displayed.
